>What can LLMs do for KGs? Or, in other words, what role can KG play in the era of LLMs?

🙌 This repository collects papers integrating **knowledge graphs (KGs)** and **large language models (LLMs)**.

😎 Welcome to recommend missing papers through **`Adding Issues`** or **`Pull Requests`**. 

<!-- Details of summary and classification of papers are shown in [wiki](https://github.com/zjukg/KG-LLM-Papers/wiki). -->

## 🔔 News
- **`2023-11` We preprint our paper [Knowledgeable Preference Alignment for LLMs in Domain-specific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06503) and release the [[`Repo`](https://github.com/zjukg/KnowPAT)].**
- **`2023-10` We preprint our paper [Making Large Language Models Perform Better in Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06671) and release the [[`Repo`](https://github.com/zjukg/KoPA)].**
- **`2023-06` We create this repository to maintain a paper list on `Intergrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models`.**

### 🎉 Contributing ( welcome ! )

- ✨ Add a new paper or update an existing KG-related LLM paper.
- 🧐 Use the same format as existing entries to describe the work.
- 😄 A very brief explanation why you think a paper should be added or updated is recommended (Not Neccessary) via **`Adding Issues`** or **`Pull Requests`**.

**Don't worry if you put something wrong, they will be fixed for you. Just feel free to contribute and promote your awesome work here! 🤩 We'll get back to you in time ~ 😉**
